# Here is the specification for properties shared by all Abilities. They are
# implicitly present as entries in the "properties" object of each Ability.
#
# Properties specifications use the following fields:
#
# summary - short, one-line description
# type - data type of the property
#
# When "type" is a number type (int, float):
#
# minValue - minimum value the property can hold
# maxValue - maximum value the property can hold
#
# When "type" is "list":
#
# minItems - minimum number of items that must be present
# maxItems - maximum number of items that can be present
#
# When "type" is "object":
#
# properties - nested property specification that describes the value

common:

  delay:
    summary: time it takes to act
    notes: |
      this value represents the number of ticks the ability takes to execute
    type: int
    minValue: 1

# Here is the specification for each specific Ability. Each entry uses the
# following fields:
#
# name - a unique, human-readable identifier, ASCII letters only
# summary - a short, one line description
# inherits - list of abilities to inherit properties from
# notes - additional information; may span multiple lines
# properties - supported properties indexed by property name
# defaults - default values for each property
# conversions - value conversions related to specific properties
